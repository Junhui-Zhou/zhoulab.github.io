Yamei Wang is a Research Assistant at the DBSGI Research Group. She is always passionate about her research work🙋, full of expectations💡, and never anxious🌱. She said that insisting on anxiety will make her dormant(hahaha). In addition, when she writes, she will especially want to buy things, such as once buying a 5 4-piece set and 3 summer quilts. She has a wide range of hobbies, such as playing badminton🎾, but she is always abused; in addition, she also likes reading📖, although reading has nothing to do with scientific research; oh, by the way, she also likes writing📝, usually recording what she dreamed of yesterday. In addition, she once jokingly ranked that she was also a new type of three-good student😎: good body, good heart, and good mentality.

**王亚梅**是草莓发育生物学与种质资源创新实验室科研助理，她总是对自己的研究工作充满热情🙋，满怀期待💡，从不焦虑🌱。她说若是焦虑会自我休眠（hahahaha）。另外，她写文章时会特别想买东西，比如说曾经一次买了五个四件套和三个夏凉被。她的爱好很广泛，比如打羽毛球🎾，不过总是被虐；此外她还特别喜欢读书📖，虽然读的和科研没什么相关；哦对了，同时她也特别喜欢写作📝，一般都是记录昨天做了什么梦。另外她曾打趣地说道她还是新型三好学生获得者😎：身体好，心眼好，心态好。
