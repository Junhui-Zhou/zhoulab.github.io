Zhu Caicun is a Research Assistant at the DBSGI Research Group. His job responsibilities mainly focus on analyzing the interaction mechanism between strawberry and the biotrophic obligate parasite, the strawberry powdery mildew pathogen (*Podosphaora aphanis*): 1. Finding genes that confer resistance to powdery mildew in strawberry, analyzing its disease resistance mechanism, and creating disease-resistant varieties; 2. Screening the effector proteins of the powdery mildew pathogen and analyzing its function in the pathogenic process.

**朱财存**是草莓发育生物学与种质资源创新实验室的科研助理，他的工作职责主要聚焦于解析草莓与活体营养性专性寄生菌——草莓白粉病病原菌(*Podosphaora aphanis*)的互作机制：1.寻找草莓中抗白粉病的基因，解析其抗病机制，创建抗病品种；2. 筛选白粉病病原菌的效应蛋白，解析其在致病过程中的功能。
