Xianyan Han is a Ph.D. candidate at DBSGI Research Group (jointly-trained with Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences). His main research focus on screening pivotal genes and decoding molecular interaction networks underlying strawberry resistance to anthracnose (*Colletotrichum spp.*), and developing novel disease-resistant germplasm using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgene-free precision editing. He is committed to bridging molecular breeding design with plant immunity theory, and actively seeks global collaborations to co-develop proprietary molecular modules for strawberry disease resistance.


**韩先焱**是草莓发育生物学与种质资源创新实验室的联合培养博士生（中国农业科学院）。他的研究课题主要是草莓响应炭疽病候选基因挖掘与分子机制解析，并通过基因编辑技术获得无转基因成分的抗病新种质。他期待未来希望与各位同行积极沟通交流。
