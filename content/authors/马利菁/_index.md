Lijing Ma is an Assistant Investigator at the DBSGI Research Group. Her research direction mainly focuses on discovering strawberry disease-resistant genes through forward genetics and reverse genetics, and analyzing their functional mechanisms, and ultimately using gene editing to create new disease-resistant strawberry varieties to solve the difficulties in improving strawberry disease resistance and yield.

**马利菁**是草莓发育生物学与种质资源创新实验室的助理研究员。她的研究方向主要是通过正向遗传与反向遗传学，挖掘草莓抗/感病基因，并解析其作用机理，最终借助基因编辑创建抗病草莓新种质，解决草莓抗病和产量协同改良困难的问题。
