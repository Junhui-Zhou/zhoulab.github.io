Ye Liang was a Research Assistant at the DBSGI Research Group. She mainly engaged in the development and quality formation of raspberry fruits, particularly skilled in constructing the dynamic regulation network of metabolites for pears and raspberries. She currently involved in the field of synthetic biology. In addition to research work, he performed the Dai ethnic solo dance 'Mist and Rain in the Small Town' at the annual meeting. Her MBTI personality test shows he belongs to the ENFJ personality type, a trait that aligns well with his communication and coordination abilities in interdisciplinary research. She is currently a Ph.D. candidate jointly trained by Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University and Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

**梁晔**是草莓发育生物学与种质资源创新实验室的前科研助理，主要从事树莓果实发育及品质建成，尤其擅长梨与树莓果实代谢物质动态调控网络的构建，目前从事合成生物学领域。除科研工作外，曾在年会中表演傣族独舞《烟雨小镇》，MBTI性格测试显示其属于ENFJ型人格，这种特质与其在跨学科研究中的沟通协调能力形成良好契合。现为西北农林科技科技大学与中科院天津工业生物技术研究所联合培养博士生。
