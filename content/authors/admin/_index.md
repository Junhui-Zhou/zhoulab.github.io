**Zhou Junhui** is a principal investigator at the Peking University of Institute of Advanced Agricultural Sciences(PKU-IAAS), leading the Developmental Biology of Strawberry & Germplasm Innovation research group, focusing primarily on wild strawberries, cultivated strawberries, and raspberries. Currently, the main research interests of the DBSGI research group are as follows:<br />
1. Molecular mechanisms of fruit development in the *Rosaceae* family <br /> 
2. Interaction mechanisms between strawberries and fungal microorganisms <br /> 
3. Optimization and application of gene editing technology in plants like strawberries and raspberries <br /> 
4. Molecular mechanisms of morphological development in raspberries (such as thorns and fruits) <br />


**周军会**是北京大学现代农业研究院的首席研究员，他所领导的草莓发育生物学与种质资源创新研究小组以森林草莓、栽培草莓和树莓为主要研究对象。目前DBSGI研究小组主要的研究工作如下：<br />
1. 蔷薇科果实发育的分子机制 <br />
2. 草莓与真菌微生物的互作机制 <br />
3. 基因编辑技术在草莓树莓等作物中的优化与应用 <br />
4. 树莓形态发育（皮刺、果实）的分子机制 <br />

Welcome doctoral and master's students and young scholars who are interested in the research of the research group to join us and develop together!

欢迎对DBSGI研究小组研究感兴趣的博士和硕士学生以及年轻学者加入我们，共同发展！
